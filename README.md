# Cloud Foundry R Buildpack

A '[R](http://www.r-project.org/)' buildpack for [CloudFoundry](http://cloudfoundry.org/) that includes [Rserve](https://rforge.net/Rserve/) for supporting remote callers using an Rserve client library available in many languages. This is a fork of the [heroku-buildpack-r](https://github.com/virtualstaticvoid/heroku-buildpack-r) with modifications made mainly to the [compile](https://github.com/pivotalservices/java-r-buildpack/blob/master/bin/compile) script to enable an easier path for integration with the CloudFoundry [java-buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack) when using the [heroku-buildpack-multi](https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi).

## Example Java Usage
```bash
$ cd ~/workspace/java-r-buildpack/test/java
$ mvn install
$ cf push --no-route
```

## Example Ruby Usage
```bash
$ cd ~/workspace/java-r-buildpack/test/ruby
$ cf push
$ open http://rrubyapp.10.244.0.34.xip.io
```

## Caveats
R may fail to install when pushing an app to CF using a [bosh-lite](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite) warden stemcell due to the following error:
```
libreadline.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

This happens because the R binary relies on an older version of libreadline shared library than the one that comes installed on the stemcell.
Rather than installing the older version onto the root partition, to get around this I created a symbolic link that maps the one R is looking for to the one on the stemcell:

```bash
root:/var/vcap/packages/rootfs_lucid64/lib# ln -n ./libreadline.so.6 libreadline.so.5
```
